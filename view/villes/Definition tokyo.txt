Traditionally, the home of the Emperor is considered the capital. From 794 through 1868, the Emperor lived in Heian-kyo, modern-day Kyoto.[4] [5] After 1868, the seat of the Government of Japan and the location of the Emperor's home was moved to Edo, which it renamed Tokyo.[6]

In 1941, the Ministry of Education published the "designation of Tokyo as capital" (????, Tokyo-tento).[7]

While no laws have designated Tokyo as the Japanese capital, many laws have defined a "capital area" (???, shuto-ken) that incorporates Tokyo. Article 2 of the Capital
 Area Consolidation Law (??????) of 1956 states: "In this Act, the term 'capital area' shall denote a broad region comprising both the territory of the Tokyo Metropolis
 as well as outlying regions designated by cabinet order." This implies that the government has designated Tokyo as the capital of Japan, although (again) it is not explicitly 
stated, and the definition of the "capital area" is purposely restricted to the terms of that specific law.[8]

As of 2007, there is a movement to transfer the government functions of the capital from Tokyo while retaining Tokyo as the de facto capital, with the Gifu-Aichi region, the Mie-Kio

 region and other regions submitting bids for a de jure capital. Officially, the relocation is referred to as "capital functions relocation" instead of "capital relocation", or as "relocation 
of the Diet and other organizations".[10][11]
